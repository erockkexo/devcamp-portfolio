Devise install: 
	rails generate devise:install

Initializers is for setting up custom settings with devise
locals is for different languages like spanish or mandarin 

in devise.rb
	lets you set length and stuff. 

change the mailer_sender attribute
	support@devcamp.com as an example 

To setup we need to define a default URL in our environment files:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

       Host should say your site.com when you put it in production

Set root which we have already done in the routes file


Next is to setup flash message in the application HTML layout

Then we setup a generator to create the view files for devise sop we can see it. 
	rails g devise:views in cli

Registrations is like creating an account or password creation, 
Sessions is when you are loggin into the application 


Next we have to use devise for what ever model we want to secure. This time we created one for 
User:
	rails generate devise User

	This updates the route table and creates a user model file --> Models: user.rb

	In User.rb there are a lot of customizable functions like confirmable which means you have to 
	receive a valid email reponse in order to create an account. This like shits on robots. 



IF we wanted to add custom fields. 

In the devise_create_users.rb file there is a database migration, 
we are going to add a custom firstname and last name for better user experience. 

	##Custom Fields 
	t.string :name

	Then we migrated the database: rails db:migrate

IMPORTANT**** make sure to restart the server when reconfiguring the routes table.
